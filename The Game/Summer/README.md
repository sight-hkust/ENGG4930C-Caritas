# Introduction of Game

As an undergraduate student project of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, the CollaBox(as 'this game') is a collaborative game developed by Student Innovation for Global Health Technology(SIGHT) for students with speacial needs(as 'users' below). Through this game, SIGHT aims at helping users develop a positive collborative learning habit with peers and enhance their daily life knowledge. 

To facilitate users' control of game and thus enhancing the gaming experience, we has tailor-designed an input console called InBox. The InBox consisted of a Sanwa joystick and a Sanwa button, which are connected to an Arduino Mega board, which are held by a ABS filamented 3D printed.

This project was kick started in 2019 December and the official devlopment of this game was 2020 January. SIGHT's Student team gives a token of thanks to the partner school Caritas Lok Kan School, and the endless support from SIGHT's Teaching Team.
